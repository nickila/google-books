# Google Book Search

## Find books and save them to a database

This app will allow a user to search for a book by keyword. When a user searches a word or words, Google API sends back ten results. The page will display the title, author, synopsis, an image of the cover and a link to the book on google books. The user is able to save the books to an online database using mLab through Heroku. Once the user has books saved to the database, they can then click on Saved Books and see all the books they've saved. They can then delete the books from their saved lists or click the link to see more about the book on the google books site.

Technologies used: React, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, Node.js, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Heroku, mLab and the Google Books API.

This app was created by Brian Nickila for the University of Minnesota Full-Stack Coding BootCamp following detailed instructions.
